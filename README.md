## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a big fan of open source and building community, and try to regularly find opportunities to get involved. When Iâ€™m not getting lost in my browser tabs, I like to spend time outdoors, boulder and do aerial silks.

I'm working on bringing my interests together: dev, open source, building community, supporting and empowering underrepresented people, [writing](https://blog.sharons.site), [speaking](https://sharons.site/speaking) and illustrating. If you'd like to discuss something or have some ideas for me, please get in touch! :)

Currently, I lead an Engineering Team. Day to day, I'm coding, researching, prototyping and growing the team! On the side, I do a bit of career coaching and freelance work, and sometimes work on personal/collaborative projects.

For more on me, visit [sharons.site](https://sharons.site/).
