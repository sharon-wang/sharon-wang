# hi! üëã

Lately, I‚Äôve been building data science and developer tools, learning about IDEs and judging grant proposals. I‚Äôm very curious about organizational systems, structure and process. I prefer to build [open source](https://github.com/issues?q=involves%3Asharon-wang+is%3Apublic) software and support open knowledge sharing.

Previously, I‚Äôve worked on an open source Java runtime [[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/7e6038dbc3e3a84e86716198640fe92dffa5ce84/artwork/OpenJ9.svg" alt="openj9 logo" width="64" align="center"/>]](https://github.com/sharon-wang#openj9-java-virtual-machine-), code security analysis tools [[<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a7db6ae5ed27b2326af3b3fe14d5556ca0d35960c6ea5196850d013a9fa741bd/68747470733a2f2f7265736869667473656375726974792d636f6e74656e742e73332e63612d63656e7472616c2d312e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f69636f6e732f726573686966742e706e67" alt="reshift security logo" width="72" align="center"/>]](https://github.com/sharon-wang#reshift-security-static-analysis-tool-), a vulnerability management system [['Portal']](https://github.com/sharon-wang#software-secured-vulnerability-management-portal), and interactive tooling for learning about Web Monetization [[<img src="https://github.com/esse-dev/akita/raw/main/assets/icons/icon_64x64.png" alt="akitaproject.site logo" width="24" align="center"/>]](https://github.com/sharon-wang#the-akita-project-).

I like to be involved in every step of the creative process: ideation ‚Üî design ‚Üî implementation ‚Üî documentation ‚Üî testing ‚Üî release ‚Üî support ‚Üî community. I‚Äôm happiest when building with collaborators and directly engaging with who I‚Äôm building for.

Sometimes I do speaking engagements, career coaching and freelance work. Otherwise, I‚Äôm probably bouldering at a climbing gym üßóüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, biking on a pathway üö¥üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è or learning a new hobby ü•Å.

    <summary>my previous work</summary>

## [OpenJ9 Java Virtual Machine](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/7e6038dbc3e3a84e86716198640fe92dffa5ce84/artwork/OpenJ9.svg" alt="openj9 logo" width="64" align="center"/>

I was part of the Virtual Machine subteam of OpenJ9. My main contributions can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pulls?q=involves%3Asharon-wang+). I worked on extending JDK functionality, implementing startup performance enhancements, and unifying the CMake build configuration to support both compressed references and large heap in a single package.

## Reshift Security Static Analysis Tool <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a7db6ae5ed27b2326af3b3fe14d5556ca0d35960c6ea5196850d013a9fa741bd/68747470733a2f2f7265736869667473656375726974792d636f6e74656e742e73332e63612d63656e7472616c2d312e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f69636f6e732f726573686966742e706e67" alt="reshift security logo" width="72" align="center"/>

I worked on prototyping new functionality around vulnerability remediation, as well as the Reshift VS Code IDE Extension. I got to play around with the [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) parser generator, use and [contribute to](https://github.com/issues?q=involves%3Asharon-wang+is%3Apublic+org%3Asouffle-lang) a Datalog variant for static analysis called [Souffl√©](https://souffle-lang.github.io/), and learn how to package and publish a VS Code Extension.

Unfortunately, the startup has since shut down, so the publicly remaining artifacts of this work are the [NPM listing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reshiftsecurity/reshift-plugin-npm), [Product Hunt page](https://www.producthunt.com/products/reshift-security). 

## [Software Secured](https://www.softwaresecured.com/) Vulnerability Management Portal

I co-architected the full-stack app, led development and deployment, and managed a small development team. This is a closed-source application with minimal publicly available information.

The main features I implemented were automated email notifications for upcoming penetration test tasks, a dashboard which organizes the client's software vulnerabilities, role-based access control and automated communications between the client and our penetration testing team.

## [The Akita Project](https://akitaproject.site) <img src="https://github.com/esse-dev/akita/raw/main/assets/icons/icon_64x64.png" alt="akitaproject.site logo" width="24" align="center"/>
Coded, designed, wrote, spoke and illustrated for [The Akita Project](https://akitaproject.site), a [Grant for the Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/) funded project that teaches [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org) concepts through storytelling, easy-to-use tools and community outreach. This project was co-created with [Elliot](https://github.com/vezwork).
