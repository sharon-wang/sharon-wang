### Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm a big fan of open source and building community, and try to regularly find opportunities to get involved. Aside from coding, I also enjoy designing, writing, speaking and illustrating. When I‚Äôm not getting lost in my browser tabs, I like to spend time outdoors, boulder and do aerial silks.

Currently, I'm the Technical Lead, R&D @ [Software Secured](https://softwaresecured.com), coding, researching and prototyping! On the side, I do a bit of career coaching and freelance work, and sometimes work on personal/collaborative projects.
