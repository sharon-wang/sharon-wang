### Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm a big fan of open source and building community, and try to regularly find opportunities to get involved. Aside from coding, I also enjoy designing, [writing](https://blog.sharons.site), [speaking](https://sharons.site/speaking) and illustrating. When I‚Äôm not getting lost in my browser tabs, I like to spend time outdoors, boulder and do aerial silks.

Currently, I lead an Engineering Team. Day to day, I'm coding, researching, prototyping and growing the team! On the side, I do a bit of career coaching and freelance work, and sometimes work on personal/collaborative projects.

I'm working on bringing my interests together: dev, open source, building community, supporting and empowering underrepresented people, writing, speaking and illustrating. If you'd like to discuss something or have some ideas for me, please get in touch! :)
